# Cloning project
If you are using linux you need to install git-lfs with something like: `apt install git-lfs`.

*Git-for-windows seems to have it out of the box, so you don't need to install anything.*

Now install git lfs localy before cloning the repo with this command: `git lfs install --skip-repo`

And finally you can `git clone` this repository.

After cloning process will be done, git-lfs will start to download large binaries from remote server. Git will ask you for http basic auth. You can find credentials in a confluence.
